dpkg-git
========

A Debian package to allow installing from a git repository with valid Debian control files.

## What is this?

This is a command that can build and/or install Debian from a git repository, local or remote.

### Remote repos

For remote repositories it will clone them into `/tmp/src` before running any operations.

### Building repos

When building a repo it will remove any files from the root directory (usually stuff like LICENCE or README files) and put them in `usr/doc/<package-name>`.  It will of course remove all git files/folders before building.  This is to ensure a clean root directory, while also allowing repos to contain README files in their for sites like Github and Bitbucket.

When using `-b` the deb package will be dropped in the current directory, and when using `-i` it will be dropped into `/tmp/`.

## How to install

It's not in a repo yet so run these commands:

```sh
wget http://penguinpowernz.github.io/dpkg-git/downloads/dpkg-git_latest.deb;
sudo dpkg -i dpkg-git_latest.deb;
```

## How to use as a git command

Simply run `git deb` from inside the repo you want to package up:

```sh
$ pwd
/home/me/src/myrepo
$ ls -la
.git
DEBIAN
README.md
$ git deb
/home/me/src/myrepo_0.1_all.deb
```

It saves it to the parent directory so you don't dirty your repo.

Or specify a folder to package:

```sh
$ git deb myrepo
myrepo_0.1_all.deb
```

Easy!

## How to use as a dpkg command

Build a package from a local repository:

```sh
$ dpkg-git -b my-cool-repo.git
my-cool-repo_1.0_all.deb
```

Build a package from a github repo:

```sh
$ dpkg-git -b https://github.com/penguinpowernz/dork-detector.git                                                                               4 â†µ

## Changing the Architecture on the fly

You can change the architecture on the fly simply by setting `ARCH=` before running it:

```
$ ARCH=armhf dpkg-git -b dork-detector
dork-detector_1.0_armhf.deb
```
