It will of course remove all git files/folders before building.  This is to ensure a clean root directory, while also allowing repos to contain README files in their for sites like Github and Bitbucket.\r\n\r\nWhen using `-b` the deb package will be dropped in the current directory, and when using `-i` it will be dropped into `/tmp/`.\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\n\r\nIt's not in a repo yet so run these commands:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nwget http://penguinpowernz.github.io/dpkg-git/dpkg-git_latest.deb;\r\nsudo dpkg -i dpkg-git_latest.deb;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nBuild a package from a local repository:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ dpkg-git -b my-cool-repo.git\r\nmy-cool-repo_1.0_all.deb\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild a package from a github repo:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ dpkg-git -b https://github.com/penguinpowernz/dork-detector.git                                                                               4 â†µ\r\nCloning into '/tmp/src/dork-detector'...\r\nremote: Counting objects: 23, done.\r\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (17/17), done.\r\nremote: Total 23 (delta 1), reused 20 (delta 0)\r\nUnpacking objects: 100% (23/23), done.\r\ndork-detector_0.1_all.deb\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall a package from a local repo:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ndpkg-git -i iprules \r\n(Reading database ... 127358 files and directories currently installed.)\r\nPreparing to replace iprules 1.0.2 (using /tmp/iprules_1.1_all.deb) ...\r\nUnpacking replacement iprules ...\r\nSetting up iprules (1.1) ...\r\nDo you want to install default rules?
